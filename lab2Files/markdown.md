Part 1 reflection:
I was having issues with bash on my computer so I wasn’t able to replicate everything from the java program. I also struggled a little when trying to understand the syntax for bash. However, I feel like it was easier to work with bash for this specific program. I liked that I didn’t have to import any classes to the bash program to make it work the way I wanted. For the java program, I had to import 5 different libraries, I don’t know if there’s a more efficient way that requires less libraries but that was the easiest way to do it for me. The bash program had more lines but I believe I could make it shorter if I become more accustomed to the language.

Part 2 reflection:
I don’t know which one is easier to work with since bash was not working properly for me, but I think that the makefile program was pretty straight forward. I think I would use makefile more since it’s the only one I’ve experimented with.

Part 3 reflection:
Making the awk program clicked for me when I saw the csv file in a spreadsheet format. After that it was easier to under how the values were stored and how to sort through them. I watched a couple of youtube videos of people sorting data through awk and that also helped a lot. I think creating a group chat with my teammates was a good idea since we would keep track of each other’s progress and ask for help if we were stuck.
